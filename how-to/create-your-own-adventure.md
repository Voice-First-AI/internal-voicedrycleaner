# Create your Own Adventure

## Get Started

Now that we have made friends & learned from their stories, we have to create an adventure to help them save the Princess and blow up the Death Star. Our noble steed is headed towards the dry cleaning kingdom. **We are solving problems for the dry cleaning kingdom using voice technology powered by AI**. This section is all about creating adventures for voice. If you are setting goals, this is where you should start. **You are accountable for creating adventures that solve friend's problems.** On your adventures to creating your own adventure, you will learn the following skills:

1. Sprint Goals
2. Standup Goals
