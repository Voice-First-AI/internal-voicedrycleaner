# Selina - Store Finder

## Getting Started

Currently, on Google you can't have meaningful interactions with search results. You **can** say: "_Find a tattoo parlor near me"_ and you will get the closest tattoo parlors to your location.You **can't** book an appointment, learn more about the store, etc. **With Selina, you can power your business voice assistant with Store Finder powers.** 

Let's explore what it does...
